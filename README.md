## Elements CSV file format
The files to define a label vocabulary can be downloaded from Elements - System Admin - Manage Label Schemes, edited and re-loaded. 
The three column headers are necessary, but it is not necessary to have values in Code and Description. The existing codes are internal keys from Gateway, and are not required. I do not know if the same codes are used in Agresso.

I think these lists were derived from the Gateway database about five years ago

## MESH Frequencies
Frequencies of MESH terms across all publications in Elements. Most terms appear more than once as they can be arrived at through multiple routes in MESH. the Category code is the first character in the full code, denoting the major tree e.g.
* A - Physiology
* B - Species
* C - Disease
* etc
